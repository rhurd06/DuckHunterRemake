# DuckHunterRemake

## Description
Duration: 1 week sprint

We are recreating a childhood favorite game: Duck Hunt. The most basic concept is to 'shoot' the birds as they fly up. Traditionally this was a video game where you would have a toy gun to shoot them, but in our version you'll use the mouse. The object is to get all the birds before they fly away.

## Acknowledgements
We'd like to thank Mintbean for providing this opportunity through their Hiring Hackathon and challenging us to create a game. We'd also like to thank our friends and family for their continuous support and encouragement. I personally would like to thank my little guy Lamar for being my inspiration to create a game easy enough for a 4 year old to play!
