# DuckHunterRemake

## Description
Duration: 1 week sprint

We are recreating a childhood favorite game: Duck Hunt. The most basic concept is to 'shoot' the birds as they fly up. Traditionally this was a video game where you would have a toy gun to shoot them, but in our version you'll use the mouse. The object is to get all the birds before they fly away.

## Installation

1. Fork or clone the repository and open in your favorite code editor; we used VS Code
1. Open a terminal window (making sure you're in the DuckHunterRemake file) and run npm install

We deployed the game to Heroku using our GitHub repository. This is how we deployed it, although there are many other ways as well:
1. Click 'New' on the righthand side
1. Click 'Create New App'
1. Type in the name on the app
1. Click 'Create App'
1. Click 'GitHub'
1. Type in the name of the GitHub Repo
1. Click 'Enable automatic deploys'
1. Click 'Deploy Branch'
Then you should be able to open the app and start playing or sharing the link.

## Acknowledgements
We'd like to thank Mintbean for providing this opportunity through their Hiring Hackathon and challenging us to create a game. We'd also like to thank our friends and family for their continuous support and encouragement. I personally would like to thank my little guy Lamar for being my inspiration to create a game easy enough for a 4 year old to play!
